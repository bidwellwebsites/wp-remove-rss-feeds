# wp-remove-rss-feeds

This plugin disables RSS feeds in Wordpress. It has no configration options. Simply enable the plugin, and RSS feeds will be disabled, along with removing the tags from the head of your pages. Many Wordpress websites do not need the default RSS functionality if they don't have blogs, so the feeds can safely be disabled.

We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com/) to help keep the code generated by Wordpress as lean as possible.
